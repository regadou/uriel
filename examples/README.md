Here are some examples of uriel scripts. To run them, you need a symbolic link in your path named uriel to the run.sh script in the parent folder. You can then execute each script by just typing the path to it (preceding the name with ./ if it is in your current directory). If you don't have a symlink to the run.sh script, you can still execute the script by giving the uriel file as a parameter to the run.sh script.

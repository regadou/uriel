To run the example:
- build the URIEL application
- make sure you have a symlink to the run.sh script named uriel in your PATH variable
- cd to this directory
- ./build-and-run.uriel
- once the script is done, go to http://localhost:4242/ or http://localhost:4242/data
- since the code is still buggy, you might want to test one by one expressions in the uriel script
